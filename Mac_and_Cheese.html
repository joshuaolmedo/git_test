        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
       
            <li>In a pot, put in 4 cups of milk</li>
            <li>Put in medium heat, we are going to make it slightly boil. Stir once in a while for the milk to not burn.</li>
            <li>Once in a boil, put 12 ounces of pasta.</li>
            <li>On medium low heat, let it cook for about 10-15 minutes until all milk is absorbed by the pasta.</li>
